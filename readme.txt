== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I have to install any software on my server to make this work? =

Absolutely not. Lucep is a hosted click to call service. The <a href="https://lucep.com/?utm_medium=wordpress&utm_campaign=lucep-plugin&utm_source=wordpress-plugin-faq">Lucep</a> servers will take care of all the heavy lifting for you. Simply configure the plugin, and you're done.

= Is it free to use? =

Lucep has a free plan specially designed for regular Wordpress users. Business users can purchase upgrade options at any time.

= Can I customise the text and colours? =

Yes you can! Once you have installed the widget you can use the Lucep dashboard to customise all the text on the widget, your open and close times, the colours, and pretty much everything else!

= Which web browsers work with this plugin? =

We continually test the compatibility of our widget with all major browsers and full functionality is available for IE11+, and all recent versions of Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari. For older browsers, or ones that do not support JavaScript there is a reduced functionality option that gets automatically made available to them.

= Does this plugin communicate with other servers? =

Yes. When you connect your account this plugin needs to check your login details by communicating with the Lucep servers - it then adds the widget code to your WordPress footer. Thereafter, each time a visitor loads a page on your site, the plugin will load the Lucep widget using high speed Akamai CDNs. When a visitor requests for a callback, their name and number is sent securely to the Lucep servers, and then your sales team is instantly notified.
